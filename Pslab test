Your app is good but 
1. First, a fall uses a different color for different work so the user can identify it very easily. 
2. There are many options which do not work on the Android app .you should provide more function like including maths formula.
3. The presentation of the accelerometer should be more attractive.
4. Gas sensor and dust sensor are not used fully for Android phones because we need an additional instrument for that.
